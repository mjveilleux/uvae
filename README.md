UVAE - Ultimate Vim Analytics Engineer: the last IDE for Analytics Engineers

Jumping between workspaces and contexts with VSCode and RStudio for exploratory and development work sucks.

This repo is intended to be a roadmap for developing a NeoVim environment that:
  - handles sql exploratory work and development
  - allows plots and statistcal analyses in R / Quarto
  - Has a Stan plugin for syntax checking and what not
  - manages python environments with ease
  - allows me to seamless work between repos and playground environments for when I need to check things


The aim is to create a workspace for me (ML Engineers, Analytics Engineers, Data Scientists and Analysts) that is a one stop shop to quickly update and run my code base.

At the end of this, we should have one IDE that I can use to update and check any parts of my datapipeline, from python commands, to my models in Stan.
